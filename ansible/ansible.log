2025-08-04 08:07:46,861 p=3334 u=runner n=ansible ERROR| ERROR! this task 'include' has extra params, which is only allowed in the following modules: win_shell, add_host, command, set_fact, meta, raw, include_tasks, include_vars, shell, group_by, script, import_tasks, win_command, include_role, import_role

The error appears to be in '/home/runner/work/devops/devops/ansible/playbooks/site.yml': line 22, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

The error appears to be in '/home/runner/work/devops/devops/ansible/playbooks/nginx.yml': line 252, column 11, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

          	# Logging
          ^ here
There appears to be a tab character at the start of the line.

YAML does not use tabs for formatting. Tabs should be replaced with spaces.

For example:
    - name: update tooling
      vars:
        version: 1.2.3
#    ^--- there is a tab there.

Should be written as:
    - name: update tooling
      vars:
        version: 1.2.3
# ^--- all spaces here.
